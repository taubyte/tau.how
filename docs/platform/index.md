# Platform Management

This section covers deploying and managing Taubyte cloud infrastructure in production. You'll learn about deployment strategies, CI/CD pipelines, environment management, and operational best practices.

## Infrastructure Options

Taubyte provides flexible deployment options:

### Manual Deployment

Complete control over infrastructure setup:

- Configure nodes individually
- Set up networking and security
- Manage certificates and domains
- Fine-tune performance settings

### Automated Deployment (Spore Drive)

Streamlined deployment with code:

- Infrastructure as Code approach
- Multi-cloud support
- Automated configuration
- Simplified management

## Production Considerations

### Planning Your Infrastructure

- **Node Distribution**: Geographic placement for performance
- **Resource Allocation**: CPU, memory, and storage planning
- **Network Architecture**: Security and connectivity design
- **Scalability**: Growth and capacity planning

### Security and Compliance

- **Access Control**: Authentication and authorization
- **Network Security**: Firewalls and encrypted communication
- **Certificate Management**: Automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt
- **Audit Logging**: Compliance and monitoring

### Operational Excellence

- **Monitoring**: Health checks and performance metrics
- **Backup and Recovery**: Data protection strategies
- **Updates and Maintenance**: Platform and security updates
- **Incident Response**: Troubleshooting and resolution

## CI/CD and Deployment

### Git-Native Workflows

- **Branch-Based Environments**: Separate dev, staging, and production
- **Automatic Builds**: Triggered by Git pushes
- **Deployment Pipelines**: Controlled promotion through environments
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Quick recovery from issues

### Environment Management

- **Development**: Local testing with Dream
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing environment
- **Production**: Live applications serving users
- **Feature Branches**: Isolated testing of new features

## Getting Started

### For New Deployments

1. **Plan your infrastructure** requirements and architecture
2. **Choose deployment method**: Manual for control, Spore Drive for automation
3. **Set up monitoring** and operational procedures
4. **Deploy applications** using CI/CD pipelines

### For Existing Applications

1. **Assessment**: Review current setup and requirements
2. **Migration Planning**: Plan the transition to production
3. **Testing**: Validate functionality in staging environment
4. **Go-Live**: Deploy to production with monitoring
