# Fundamentals

<!-- Source: Based on docs-old structure -->

This section covers the core concepts and architecture that make Taubyte unique. Understanding these fundamentals will help you make better decisions when building applications and managing infrastructure.

## Core Concepts

Taubyte is built on several key principles that differentiate it from traditional cloud platforms:

- **Git-Native**: Everything is managed through Git repositories
- **Local Development = Global Production**: Your local environment mirrors production exactly
- **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: Distributed, resilient network design
- **WebAssembly Runtime**: Secure, fast, and portable function execution

## What You'll Learn

### Architecture Overview

Learn how Taubyte's distributed architecture works, including:

- Peer-to-peer networking
- Service discovery and routing
- Data storage and replication
- Content addressing and deduplication

### Platform Services

Understand the core services that power Taubyte:

- **Auth**: Authentication and security
- **TNS**: Configuration and project registry
- **Seer**: Network directory and DNS
- **Gateway**: Load balancing and traffic routing
- **Patrick & Monkey**: CI/CD pipeline
- **Hoarder**: Data replication
- **Substrate**: Function execution

### Key Concepts

Master the fundamental concepts:

- Git-native development workflows
- Branch-based environments
- Event-driven architecture
- Content-addressed storage
- Serverless-first design

## Why This Matters

Understanding these fundamentals will help you:

- **Build better applications** by leveraging Taubyte's unique capabilities
- **Debug issues** more effectively by understanding the underlying architecture
- **Make informed decisions** about application design and deployment strategies
- **Optimize performance** by understanding how data flows through the system
