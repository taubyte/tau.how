# Taubyte — Build Cloud Apps the Git‑Native Way

Taubyte is an open-source Serverless Operating System: git-native, code-first, secure, and built for speed. Spin up a production‑parity cloud locally, ship with CI/CD by default, and scale globally with a P2P backbone and WebAssembly.

### Getting Started

- [Install Tools →](getting-started/installation.md)
- [Run a Local Cloud →](getting-started/local-cloud.md)
- [Your First Function →](getting-started/first-function.md)

### Easy to Use, Built for Real Clouds

With a single CLI, you can create a full local cloud that mirrors production: same services, same routing, same deployment flow. Git branches map to environments, and CI/CD turns merges into deployments.

### Cloud Black Box, De‑mystified

Under the hood: a P2P fabric for discovery and routing, WebAssembly for secure multi‑tenant execution, and Git as the source of truth for infra and app config. Learn the concepts that matter:

- [Services](fundamentals/services.md)
- [Core Concepts](fundamentals/concepts.md)

### Why Taubyte?

- Git‑Native workflows with branch‑based environments
- Production parity from laptop to cloud
- P2P networking for resilience and scale
- WebAssembly runtime for safety and portability
- Zero‑config service discovery and certificates
