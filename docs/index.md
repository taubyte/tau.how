# Full‑stack Workspace for Humans and Machines

Full‑stack workspace that lets teams and coding agents build, test, and ship apps on autopilot—on their own infrastructure.

### Easy to Use, Built for Real Clouds

With a single CLI, you can create a full local cloud that mirrors production: same services, same routing, same deployment flow. Git branches map to environments, and CI/CD turns merges into deployments.

### Cloud Black Box, De‑mystified

Under the hood: a P2P fabric for discovery and routing, WebAssembly for secure multi‑tenant execution, and Git as the source of truth for infra and app config. Learn the concepts that matter:

### Why Taubyte?

- Git‑Native workflows with branch‑based environments
- Production parity from laptop to cloud
- P2P networking for resilience and scale
- WebAssembly runtime for safety and portability
- Zero‑config service discovery and certificates
