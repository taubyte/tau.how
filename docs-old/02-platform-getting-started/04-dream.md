title: Dream

Dream is package that was originally created to test tau itself. It got refactored so it can be used for writing E2E tests for projects running on tau. We also, built a CLI tool that allows local development.



Dream can be installed on Linux, Mac or Windows.

=== "Using NPM"

    ```bash
    npm i -g @taubyte/dream
    ```

=== "Using Install Script"

    ```bash
    curl https://get.tau.link/dream | sh
    ```

Starting a local cloud environment is as easy as running:
```bash
dream new multiverse
```

If you'd like to play around with dream, [Start a local Cloud](/01-dev-getting-started/01-local-cloud/) is a good place to start.
