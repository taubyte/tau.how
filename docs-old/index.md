# Welcome

Welcome to Taubyte's technical documentation!

Taubyte is an open-source Serverless Operating System. It's git-native, code-first, secure, extendable, and designed for developers. It's easy to deploy and manage, works locally, and can be tested with code, helping you build faster with fewer issues.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Building a Platform
A quick start guide for engineers who want to set up and manage their own cloud infrastructure:

1. [Platform Overview](02-platform-getting-started/00-what-is-taubyte.md)
2. [Architecture](02-platform-getting-started/01-architecture.md)
3. [Services](02-platform-getting-started/02-services.md)
4. [Tau](02-platform-getting-started/03-tau.md)
5. [Dream](02-platform-getting-started/04-dream.md)

#### Deploy Your Cloud
If you want to gain a comprehensive understanding of how tau is deployed, whether to deepen your knowledge or to utilize other tools for automation:

- [Manually deploy tau](02-platform-getting-started/10-deploy-a-cloud.md)

If you prefer to move fast, this is the way to go:

- [Deploy with Spore Drive](02-platform-getting-started/11-spore-drive.md)


#### Use your cloud
Once your cloud is up and running, regardless of deployment method:

- [Take it for a Spin!](02-platform-getting-started/12-try-the-cloud.md)

#### Extend the Platform
Taubyte is built with a modular architecture that allows you to extend the platform. AS of today we have a plugin system that allows you to add capability to the compute engine.

1. [Concepts](02-platform-getting-started/10-deploy-a-cloud.md)
2. [Hello world plugin](02-platform-getting-started/10-deploy-a-cloud.md)
3. [LLM plugin](02-platform-getting-started/10-deploy-a-cloud.md)
