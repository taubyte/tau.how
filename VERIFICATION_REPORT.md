# Documentation Verification Report

## Summary

This report documents the verification process for all claims in the Taubyte documentation and the removal of unverified content.

## Verification Process

1. **Read all documentation files** - Reviewed all 28 `.md` files in the `docs/` directory
2. **Identified technical claims** - Found claims about features, capabilities, and technical details
3. **Cross-referenced sources** - Verified claims against:
   - Official Taubyte documentation
   - GitHub repository (taubyte/tau)
   - Web search results
   - Platform documentation
4. **Removed unverified claims** - Eliminated unsupported statements

## Changes Made

### File: `docs/getting-started/introduction.md`

**Line 36**: Removed unverified claim about unikernel & container execution

**Before:**
```markdown
- **Computing**: WebAssembly, unikernel & container execution with edge capabilities
```

**After:**
```markdown
- **Computing**: WebAssembly execution with edge capabilities
```

**Reason**: The documentation states unikernels and containers are "being worked on" (Line 26), but the claim that they are currently available is not verified. Only WebAssembly execution is confirmed to be available.

### File: `docs-old/02-platform-getting-started/00-what-is-taubyte copy.md`

**Line 34**: Removed unverified claim about unikernel & container execution

**Before:**
```markdown
- **Computing**: WebAssembly, unikernel & container execution with edge capabilities
```

**After:**
```markdown
- **Computing**: WebAssembly execution with edge capabilities
```

**Reason**: Same as above - consistency with actual capabilities.

## Verified Claims (Examples)

Most documentation claims are verified:

- ✅ Taubyte is open-source and Git-native
- ✅ Peer-to-peer architecture with DHT
- ✅ WebAssembly-based serverless functions
- ✅ Content-addressed storage with deduplication
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS/TLS with Let's Encrypt
- ✅ CI/CD with build containers (Go, Rust, AssemblyScript)
- ✅ Distributed key-value databases
- ✅ Pub/Sub messaging with WebSocket support
- ✅ Dream CLI for local development
- ✅ Tau binary for production deployment

**Source**: Official Taubyte documentation at tau.how, github.com/taubyte/tau

## Notes on CI/CD Containers

The CI/CD documentation correctly describes Docker containers used for **build environments**:
- `taubyte/go-wasi:latest` - Go WASM builds
- `taubyte/rust-wasi:latest` - Rust WASM builds  
- `taubyte/assembly-script-wasi:latest` - AssemblyScript builds
- Standard containers (node, python, etc.) for website builds

These are build containers, NOT runtime execution environments. The distinction is important.

## Future Verification

For future documentation changes, verify:

1. **Technical claims** have code examples or documentation references
2. **Status claims** (e.g., "available now" vs "coming soon") are accurate
3. **Comparisons** with other platforms are fair and verifiable
4. **Performance claims** have benchmarks or evidence
5. **Feature lists** match actual implementation

## Conclusion

Only 2 instances of unverified content were found, both making the same claim about unikernel & container **runtime** execution. These have been removed. All other documentation appears accurate and verifiable.
